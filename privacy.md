The following data is collected: timestamp, message content before, message content after, message author, author profile picture, author userid. It also logs when you join and leave a channel, when you joined the Guild, and when you started using your Discord account. You can opt out of this usage by leaving the respective guild. ``*``

### Embedmaker

### Upvotes
* If you vote on a vote platform where our Discord bot is, we will save the last time you voted. If you have not voted for the bot for more than 2 months we will remove it from our database.

### Caching
* We store data from you, such as your coins for the store, in a cache. A cache is a system to make fewer requests to our database. We store your data in the cache up to 15 minutes before this data is processed again and stored in our database. ``*``

### Server shops
* We offer the function that the server owner can create a rank store on his server. We save your userID, the serverID and the ranks in the store and your coins. ``*``

### Coins
* We assign coins as soon as you perform any activity on a server. These are stored as long as you are on the server, as soon as you leave the server we keep them for 2 hours and then delete them automatically. ``*``

### Guild Information (GuildID, Invite Link)
* We store your GuildID to uniquely assign your server. This is necessary for almost every function of our bot, otherwise you will not be able to work. A unique invite link will be created from your server that will not expire. You can delete this at any time in your Guild settings

### Music System
* We give you the opportunity to listen to music with our bot. For this we process your GuildID and which song you listen to in which channel. We also check whether you are in a channel and which channel you are in if you are in a channel when you execute the command. We need this to send the bot to your voice channel. We need the GuildID and the song name to stream the song from a platform and the GuildID to use the queue system, for example.
